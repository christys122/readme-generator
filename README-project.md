# README Generator
  

  ## Description

This project is designed to showcase my new skills using node.js, npm and ES6 syntax to create a professional quality README file for projects.  It will ask the user the necessary questions and return a complete README file with a license badge a working table of contents and a place for any information you can use.  This project was difficult in the beginning but I was able to complete the project in time and working properly. I am happy to present this project.
